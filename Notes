Develop a RESTful API using PHP and Laravel that allows users to book, view, and cancel healthcare appointments. The API should interact with a MySQL database to store and retrieve data.

User: With attributes like id, name, email.
Healthcare Professional: With attributes like id, name, specialty.
Appointment: With attributes like id, user_id, healthcare_professional_id, appointment_start_time, appointment_end_time, status (booked, completed, cancelled).

User registration and login (with token-based authentication).
List all available healthcare professionals.
Book an appointment (should check for availability).
View all appointments for a user.
Cancel an appointment (with constraints, e.g., not allowed within 24 hours of the appointment time).
(Optional) Mark an appointment as completed.

Ensure no double booking for healthcare professionals.
Users can only view or cancel their appointments.
Implement basic validation (e.g., future dates for appointments).
